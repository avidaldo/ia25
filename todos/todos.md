# TODOs

This file contains a list of projects, TODOs and ideas that can be implemented and can be used to improve this repository (and your califications!)

If you want to contribute, please pick an item from the list and create a pull request with your implementation. 

## Proposals

### Notes improvements

- Compare Python vs C efficiency multiplying matrices. Why is Python slower? why is still used for scientific computing?
Why is matrix multiplication so important in AI?
    - Use numpy, cython and pypy to improve Python performance.
    - Extend the comparison to CUDA. What is CUDA? How does it work? Why is it so important for AI?
    - Extend the comparison to other languages like Julia, Mojo or any other language that is popular for scientific computing or AI.


- Any PR in current will be appreciated!

### Machine Learning Examples

- Implement a simple linear regression model from scratch.
- Develop a Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection. Explain it step by step in a notebook with a pedagogical approach, since it' s a classic example of machine learning.

### Agents / MLOps

- Create an agent that reviews every new content added to this repository and suggests improvements.
    - Use GitHub Actions to automate the process and create issues with the suggestions.

- Create an agent that translates this repository to Spanish and/or Galician every time a new commit is made to the main branch. 

- Use GitHub Actions to automate the process and update another repo with the translated content.


## How to implement the TODOs

- Create a fork of this repository.
- For each TODO, create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `compare-python-c-efficiency`).
- Implement the changes or additions as described in the TODO.
- Test your changes to ensure they work as expected.
- Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.

Using AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot is allowed and encouraged, but please make sure to review and understand the code before submitting a pull request.

You can use AI agents in background and create a PR with the results, but you will need to make a fork of this repository and create a PR with the results.
